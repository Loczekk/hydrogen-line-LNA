The aim of the project was to design, build and test a low noise amplifier operating in the L-band. The amplifier was to meet strict requirements for gain (> 30 dB) and noise figure less than 1 dB.
A two-stage amplifier was implemented as a PCB on RF4 laminate and then subjected to detailed measurements to verify its performance. Scattering parameters, noise figure, 1 dB compression point, harmonic and third-order intermodulation distortion were measured.
